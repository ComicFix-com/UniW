## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the [Deployment](#deployment) section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (for user data and game scores)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)

#### Example:
```bash
$ node -v  # To check Node.js version
v14.17.0

$ git --version  # To verify Git is installed
git version 2.30.0
```

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/username/UniW.git
$ cd UniW
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the necessary configurations:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/uniw
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey
```

#### Step 4: Run the Development Server
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

You should now have a local copy of UniW running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ESLint Configuration

To ensure code quality and maintain consistency, it's recommended to expand the ESLint configuration, especially for production applications. Follow these steps to configure ESLint with type-aware lint rules and React support:

### Step 1: Update `parserOptions`

Configure the top-level `parserOptions` to include your TypeScript configuration files:

```javascript
// eslint.config.js or .eslintrc.js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```

### Step 2: Extend Recommended Type-Checked Configurations

Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` with either `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked` to enable type-aware linting.

```javascript
export default tseslint.config({
  // ...other configurations
  extends: [
    'tseslint/configs/recommendedTypeChecked',
    // or
    'tseslint/configs/strictTypeChecked',
  ],
});
```

**Optional:** Add `stylisticTypeChecked` for additional stylistic rules.

```javascript
export default tseslint.config({
  // ...other configurations
  extends: [
    'tseslint/configs/recommendedTypeChecked',
    'tseslint/configs/stylisticTypeChecked',
  ],
});
```

### Step 3: Install `eslint-plugin-react` and Configure

Install the React plugin:

```bash
$ npm install eslint-plugin-react --save-dev
```

Update your ESLint configuration to include the React plugin and set the React version:

```javascript
// eslint.config.js or .eslintrc.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react';

export default tseslint.config({
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable React's recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
});
```

## Running the Tests

### End-to-End Tests

We use `Jest` for testing. To run all tests, use the following command:

```bash
$ npm test
```

#### Example Test:
```javascript
test('User registration', () => {
    expect(registerUser('username', 'password')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### Coding Style Tests

We enforce consistent code style using `ESLint`. Run the following to check for style violations:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

---

## Deployment

To deploy UniW on a live system, follow these additional steps:

1. **Set Up a Cloud Server:** Deploy the app to platforms like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).
2. **Environment Configuration:** Ensure environment variables such as `MONGODB_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` are properly configured for production.
3. **Start the Application:**
    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```
4. **Configure Reverse Proxy (Optional):** Use Nginx or another reverse proxy to handle requests and improve security.
